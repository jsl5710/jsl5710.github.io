# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: 'My research interests include low-resource multilingual NLP, linguistics, adversarial machine learning and mis/disinformation generation/detection. My Ph.D. thesis is in the area of applying artificial intelligence for cybersecurity and social good, with a focus on low-resource multilingual natural language processing. More specifically, I develop NLP techniques to promote cybersecurity, combat mis/disinformation, and enable AI accessibility for non-English languages and underserved populations. This involves creating novel models and techniques for tasks like multilingual and crosslingual text classification, machine translation, text generation, and adversarial attacks in limited training data settings. My goal is to democratize state-of-the-art AI capabilities by extending them beyond high-resource languages like English into the long tail of lower-resourced languages worldwide. By innovating robust learning approaches from scarce linguistic data, this research aims to open promising directions where AI can have dual benefits strengthening security, integrity and social welfare across diverse global locales.'

# Unleashing the power of NLP, I am a Ph.D. student at Penn State, delving into interdisciplinary research in Data Science and AI. As part of the [College of IST](https://ist.psu.edu/), I conduct research at the PIKE Research Lab under the guidance of [Dr. Dongwon Lee](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/). I focus on applying NLP and machine learning techniques to combat dis/misinformation across languages, contexts, and distribution gaps. At Penn State, I serve as an [NSF LinDiv](https://lindiv.la.psu.edu/) Fellow, conducting transdisciplinary research to advance human-AI languague interaction globally. My mission is to mitigate evolving security threats, risks and enhance access to human language technology for all with cutting-edge solutions. Beyond research aspirations, I stay active through dance, fitness, martial arts, and community service.

I am a PhD candidate in Informatics in the [College of IST](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Penn State University, where I conduct research at the [PIKE Research Lab](https://pike.psu.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Dongwon Lee](https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/). I specialize in AI/ML research focused on Information Integrity, Safe and Ethical AI, including combating harmful content across multiple languages and modalities. My research spans low-resource multilingual NLP, generative AI, and adversarial machine learning, with work extending across 79 languages. I have published 12 papers with 260+ citations in premier venues including ACL, EMNLP, IEEE, and NAACL.

My doctoral research focuses on bridging the digital language divide through transfer learning, classification (NLU), generation (NLG), adversarial attacks, and developing end-to-end AI pipelines using RAG and Agentic AI workflows for combating multilingual threats. Drawing from my Grenadian background and knowledge of local Creole languages, I bring a global perspective to AI challenges, working to democratize state-of-the-art AI capabilities for underserved linguistic communities worldwide. My mission is to develop robust multilingual multimodal systems and mitigate evolving security vulnerabilities while enhancing access to human language technology through cutting-edge solutions.

As an [NSF LinDiv](https://lindiv.la.psu.edu/) Fellow, I conduct transdisciplinary research advancing human-AI language interaction for social good. I actively mentor 5+ research interns and teach Applied Generative AI courses. Through industry experience at [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://www.llnl.gov/), [Interaction LLC](https://www.interactions.com/), and [Coalfire](https://coalfire.com/), I bridge academic research with practical applications in combating evolving security threats and enhancing global AI accessibility. I see multilingual advances and interdisciplinary collaboration as a competitive advantage, not a communication challenge. Beyond research, I stay active through dance, fitness, martial arts, and community service.
