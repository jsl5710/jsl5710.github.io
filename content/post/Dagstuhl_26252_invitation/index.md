I am honored to be invited to **Dagstuhl Seminar 26252: "From Speech Translation to Multilingual Communication – New Research Challenges"** taking place **June 14–17, 2026** at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany.

This invitation-only seminar will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from speech translation, interpretation studies, and human-computer interaction to explore how AI can better support multilingual communication in real-world scenarios.

The seminar's focus on bridging the gap between technical advances and end-user needs resonates deeply with my research on addressing the digital language divide. I look forward to engaging with fellow researchers on critical questions: How do we evaluate translation quality for speech? How can AI tools go beyond translation to truly empower users across language barriers?

Thank you to the organizers **Marine Carpuat**, **Claudio Fantinuoli**, **Ge Gao**, and **Jan Niehues** for this opportunity.
