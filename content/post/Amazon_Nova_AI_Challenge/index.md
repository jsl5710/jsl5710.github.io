Thrilled to be part of **Team Lion-0xA**, representing Penn State as one of **10 global finalists** in the **2026 Amazon Nova AI Challenge**!

Our team, a collaboration between the College of Information Sciences and Technology and the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, was selected from hundreds of applications worldwide to tackle one of AI's most pressing frontiers: building agentic AI systems that are both capable and trustworthy.

We're competing as a **Red Team**, which means our mission is to probe AI coding agents for vulnerabilities and identify potential security risks. This work sits right at the intersection of my research in adversarial machine learning, cybersecurity, and NLP. There's something deeply rewarding about applying offensive security thinking to make AI systems safer for everyone.

Proud to work alongside an amazing group of teammates under the guidance of **Dr. Dongwon Lee**.
