I am delighted to accept an invitation from St. George's University's Faculty Development office to facilitate a **Lunch & Learn session** on **"Ethical Use of AI in Research and Teaching"** on **March 27, 2026**.

This session will explore responsible, transparent, and ethical uses of AI in both research and teaching, with an emphasis on upholding academic integrity and maintaining professional standards. The topic is central to my current research, and I am truly honored to share insights with the SGU faculty community — a community that played such a formative role in my own academic and professional career.

Thank you to **Dr. Lisa Francis-Charles** (Director of Faculty Development) and **Ms. Reba David-Andrew** for facilitating this opportunity.
