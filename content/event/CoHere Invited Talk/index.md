summary: In this talk we present research that tackles the misuse of large language models (LLMs) by introducing the Fighting Fire with Fire (F3) strategy, which uses GPT-3.5-turbo to generate and detect disinformation. By employing advanced techniques, we achieved a 68-72% accuracy in identifying deceptive content. We also address COVID-19 misinformation in low-resource regions, focusing on the Caribbean. Using US fact-checked claims, we trained models to detect misinformation in English, Spanish, and Haitian French. Our results highlight the limitations of current methods and the need for further multilingual research.
