summary: Jason Lucas joins WXXI's "Connections" to discuss the dangers of AI-driven disinformation campaigns during crises, alongside Oxford researcher Felix Simon's insights on AI applications in journalism. The conversation explores current AI implementations in newsrooms and emerging threats from sophisticated disinformation tactics, particularly during high-impact events when accurate information is most critical.

abstract: 
  In this comprehensive radio discussion, we examine the dual nature of artificial intelligence in modern journalism - both as a tool for newsroom efficiency and as a vector for sophisticated disinformation campaigns. Jason Lucas presents research on AI-generated disinformation during crisis situations, highlighting how bad actors exploit critical moments when communities are most vulnerable to false information. The conversation covers the evolving landscape of AI applications in journalism, from automated content generation to fact-checking systems, while addressing the urgent need for robust detection mechanisms. Felix Simon contributes insights from four years of research into AI adoption in newsrooms, providing context for how the industry is adapting to these technological changes. Together, we explore the challenges facing journalists, policymakers, and technologists in maintaining information integrity while harnessing AI's beneficial capabilities.
