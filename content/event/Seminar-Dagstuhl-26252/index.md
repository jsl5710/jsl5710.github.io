I am honored to be invited to **Dagstuhl Seminar 26252: "From Speech Translation to Multilingual Communication – New Research Challenges"** taking place June 14–17, 2026 at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany.

This invitation-only seminar will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from speech translation, interpretation studies, and human-computer interaction to explore how AI can better support multilingual communication in real-world scenarios.

The seminar's focus on bridging the gap between technical advances and end-user needs resonates deeply with my research on addressing the digital language divide.

Organized by **Marine Carpuat**, **Claudio Fantinuoli**, **Ge Gao**, and **Jan Niehues**.
