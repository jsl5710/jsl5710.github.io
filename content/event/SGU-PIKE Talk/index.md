summary: 'This talk explores recent advances in AI and natural language processing. It highlights an influential EMNLP 2023 paper: “Fighting Fire with Fire” - introducing adversarial attack methods that reveal weaknesses in AI systems by inducing model misclassifications. However, it also shows the dual use for combatting harmful text. Published among 900 highly selective papers, this work epitomizes progress in strengthening robustness, while using AI’s dual capacities for good. Brief background will be provided before diving into the state of the field and latest innovations showcased across the cutting-edge EMNLP research.'

abstract: 'Artificial intelligence has progressed rapidly since its origins in the 1950s, with natural language processing emerging as a critical subfield focused on enabling human-language understanding in machines.

In this invited talk, we will discuss a highly influential paper from the 2023 Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing conference proceedings – “Fighting Fire with Fire." This work introduces new techniques for adversarial attacks against AI systems, revealing vulnerabilities by inducing model misclassifications. However, it also demonstrates the dual capacity to combat maliciously generated text. Discussing both aspects shows how the field is advancing while addressing crucial issues around safety and security.

Overall, the 2023 conference features over 900 papers spanning innovations in Large Langauge Models, translation, and more – with a highly-selective 23% acceptance rate. This represents the remarkable progress in AI, while also highlighting important frontiers related to robustness, quality assurance, and positive real-world impact as the technology grows more advanced. We look forward to an engaging overview of the latest advancements and future directions for AI.'
