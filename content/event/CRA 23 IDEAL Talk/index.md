summary: This paper examines the challenge of detecting false claims related to COVID-19 circulating online in Caribbean countries. The Caribbean's linguistic diversity and scarcity of fact-checking pose difficulties for AI models trained on English data. Experiments found classical machine learning approaches struggle to identify Caribbean false claims. More sophisticated techniques like transfer learning with multilingual models showed promise. But all models suffered reduced performance on non-English content. The paper concludes AI solutions developed for high-resource settings have limited portability to low-resource regions facing endemic barriers around data, language, and misinformation ecosystems.



abstract: I presented work at the 2023 CRA-WP Workshop detecting COVID-19 false claims in the linguistically diverse, low-resource setting of the Caribbean islands. This project analyzed how computational solutions trained solely on English data fail to capture the nuances around misinformation propagation in developing regions. Our experiments found neural networks and even powerful transformer architectures struggle when tested on non-English claims translated from Caribbean languages. My talk discussed insights around the difficulty of transferring AI models across low-resource languages and vastly different information ecosystems. I also highlighted ideas for enhancing cross-lingual understanding and inclusion in misinformation detection systems deployed in at-risk communities.
