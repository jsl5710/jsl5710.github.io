summary: I co-presented with Cristal Giorio Jackson at the 2023 NSF NRT Annual Meeting in Arizona State University. This NSF-funded research examines whether mismatching native accent variants impacts language processing for native listeners. An EEG experiment found successful semantic access occurred when listeners heard matched native variants, but unsuccessful semantic mapping when hearing unfamiliar, less intelligible variants. This suggests processing costs when speech doesn't match a native variant. The project integrates psychology, linguistics and AI to explore improving automatic speech recognition and language ID for regional/non-native accents. Techniques like leveraging EEG biomarkers and combining acoustic models with character language models may enhance accent robustness.

abstract: At the 2023 NSF NRT Annual Meeting, I presented a poster on native language processing impacts on human language technology. My collaborators and I used EEG to evaluate neural processing differences when native Spanish listeners hear matched versus mismatched native accent variants. We found evidence that unfamiliar variants incur cognitive costs. As language ID and speech recognition systems currently struggle with non-native speech, I'm integrating psychological and computational linguistics techniques to explore improvements. This project synthesizes varied disciplines - from psycholinguistics to natural language processing - to address inclusion gaps in speech technology across accent variants. Enhancing system robustness to diverse forms of speech is essential as virtual assistants and other AI applications continue permeating everyday life.
