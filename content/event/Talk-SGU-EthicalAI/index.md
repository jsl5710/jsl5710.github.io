Invited by **Dr. Lisa Francis-Charles**, Director of Faculty Development at St. George's University, to facilitate a 50-minute Lunch & Learn session on **"Ethical Use of AI in Research and Teaching"**.

This session explores responsible, transparent, and ethical uses of AI in both research and teaching, with an emphasis on upholding academic integrity and maintaining professional standards. The topic is central to my current research on information integrity and safe AI.

SGU played a formative role in my own academic and professional career, and I am honored to share insights with the faculty community.
