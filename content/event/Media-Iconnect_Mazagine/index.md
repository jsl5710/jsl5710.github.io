## Student Spotlight

This powerful profile examines how Informatics PhD student Jason Lucas is using his experiences as an underrepresented student to drive both his research and his commitment to mentoring the next generation of tech leaders.

## Key Highlights

### The Power of Mentorship
- **Mentoring philosophy** rooted in guidance from Professor Emeritus Theodore Hollis
- **Community engagement** through educational programs using dance as a gateway
- **Student support** for undergraduates working on AI for social good and multilingual NLP
- **Building independence** while providing consistent advocacy and support

### Navigating Representation Challenges
- **Stark realities**: Being one of the few Black men in his PhD program
- **Conference experiences**: Representing less than 1% of attendees at academic conferences
- **Identity transition**: From Grenada's diverse environment to academia's homogeneous spaces
- **Finding community**: Transformative experience at the BLK Men in Tech THRIVE Conference

### Research with Purpose
- **Addressing gaps**: How current AI models fail to incorporate Black Afro-Caribbean perspectives
- **Language inclusion**: The absence of Caribbean vernacular and languages like Haitian Creole
- **Community impact**: How low-resource communities are disproportionately affected by tech manipulation
- **Driving change**: Using personal identity as motivation for more inclusive technology

## Academic Impact

### Current Research Focus
Lucas mentors undergraduate students on projects spanning:
- **AI for social good** applications
- **Multilingual NLP** research through the PIKE Research Lab
- **Deepfake detection** technologies
- **Millennium Scholars** program contributions

### The PIKE Research Lab
The Penn State Information, Knowledge, and wEb (PIKE) group focuses on data management and mining across diverse forms, with particular attention to social and security applications—work that directly benefits from Lucas's inclusive perspective.

## Transformative Experiences

### BLK Men in Tech THRIVE Conference 2024
Lucas describes this experience as "profound in two ways":
- **Community building**: Bonding with IST's Black undergraduate community as their chaperone
- **Professional networking**: Connecting with Black leadership in tech and renewing belief in his potential to excel

The conference highlighted both the community Lucas found and the research gaps his work addresses.

## Philosophy in Action

> "Having navigated challenges in my own educational journey, I find deep fulfillment in helping students discover their strengths and develop strategies to overcome obstacles. I understand firsthand how important tailored guidance can be, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds or those facing additional challenges."

Lucas's approach focuses on building independence while ensuring students have reliable support, fostering both problem-solving skills and curiosity in the next generation of tech leaders.
