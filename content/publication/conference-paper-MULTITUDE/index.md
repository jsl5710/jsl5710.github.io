abstract:  There is a lack of research into capabilities of recent LLMs to generate convincing text in languages other than English and into performance of detectors of machine-generated text in multilingual settings. This is also reflected in the available benchmarks which lack authentic texts in languages other than English and predominantly cover older generators. To fill this gap, we introduce MULTITuDE, a novel benchmarking dataset for multilingual machine-generated text detection comprising of 74,081 authentic and machine-generated texts in 11 languages (ar, ca, cs, de, en, es, nl, pt, ru, uk, and zh) generated by 8 multilingual LLMs. Using this benchmark, we compare the performance of zero-shot (statistical and black-box) and fine-tuned detectors. Considering the multilinguality, we evaluate 1) how these detectors generalize to unseen languages (linguistically similar as well as dissimilar) and unseen LLMs and 2) whether the detectors improve their performance when trained on multiple languages.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This research from Penn State and KiNiT introduces MULTITuDE, a novel multilingual dataset for detecting machine-generated text. Comprised of over 74,000 authentic and artificially-generated texts in 11 languages from 8 models, MULTITuDE benchmarks text generation capabilities in non-English languages and multilingual detection performance. The dataset addresses current gaps in analyzing and systematically evaluating machine text generation and detection across multiple languages.
