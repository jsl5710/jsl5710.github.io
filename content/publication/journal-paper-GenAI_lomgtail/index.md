abstract: "Generative AI (GenAI) poses significant risks in creating convincing yet factually ungrounded content, particularly affecting \"longtail\" users who may have limited resources or technical expertise to identify and combat disinformation. This article examines how GenAI disproportionately impacts these vulnerable user groups, analyzing the structural inequalities that emerge when advanced AI systems are deployed without adequate consideration for diverse user populations and their varying capabilities to navigate AI-generated content."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
