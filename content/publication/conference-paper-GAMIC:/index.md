abstract: In-context learning (ICL) effectively conditions large language models (LLMs) for molecular tasks, such as property prediction and molecule captioning, by embedding carefully selected demonstration examples into the input prompt. This approach eliminates the computational overhead of extensive pre-training and fine-tuning. However, current prompt retrieval methods for molecular tasks rely on molecule feature similarity, such as Morgan fingerprints, which do not adequately capture the global molecular and atom-binding relationships. As a result, these methods fail to represent the full complexity of molecular structures during inference. Moreover, medium-sized LLMs, which offer simpler deployment requirements in specialized systems, have remained largely unexplored in the molecular ICL literature. To address these gaps, we propose a self-supervised learning technique, GAMIC (Graph-Aligned Molecular In-Context learning), which aligns global molecular structures, represented by graph neural networks (GNNs), with textual captions (descriptions) while leveraging local feature similarity through Morgan fingerprints. In addition, we introduce a Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) based diversity heuristic during retrieval to optimize input prompt demonstration samples. Our experimental findings using diverse benchmark datasets show GAMIC outperforms simple Morgan-based ICL retrieval methods across all tasks by up to 45%.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: GAMIC introduces a novel self-supervised learning approach for molecular in-context learning that combines graph neural networks with Morgan fingerprints to better capture molecular complexity. By aligning global molecular structures with textual descriptions and using Maximum Marginal Relevance for demonstration selection, GAMIC outperforms traditional Morgan-based retrieval methods by up to 45% across diverse molecular tasks.
