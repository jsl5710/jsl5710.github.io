    abstract = "Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced paradigm-shifting approaches in natural language processing. Yet, their transformative in-context learning (ICL) capabilities remain underutilized, especially in customer service dialogue summarization---a domain plagued by generative hallucinations, detail omission, and inconsistencies. We present Chain-of-Interactions (CoI), a novel single-instance, multi-step framework that orchestrates information extraction, self-correction, and evaluation through sequential interactive generation chains. By strategically leveraging LLMs' ICL capabilities through precisely engineered prompts, CoI dramatically enhances abstractive task-oriented dialogue summarization (ATODS) quality and usefulness. Our comprehensive evaluation on real-world and benchmark human-agent interaction datasets demonstrates CoI's effectiveness through rigorous testing across 11 models and 7 prompting approaches, with 9 standard automatic evaluation metrics, 3 LLM-based evaluations, and human studies involving 480 evaluators across 9 quality dimensions. Results reveal CoI's decisive superiority, outperforming all single-step approaches and achieving 6{\texttimes} better entity preservation, 49\% higher quality scores, and 322\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-step Chain-of-Density (CoD). This research addresses critical gaps in task-oriented dialogue summarization for customer service applications and establishes new standards for harnessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities in practical, industry-relevant contexts."
