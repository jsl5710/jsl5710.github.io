Advancing language understanding requires pushing beyond standard benchmarks into complex, real-world reasoning tasks. This project explores how in-context learning and graph-based representations can improve AI performance across diverse application domains—from summarizing task-oriented dialogue in conversational AI systems to translating structured database queries into natural language and reasoning over molecular structures for scientific discovery. These efforts contribute foundational NLP methods that support the broader mission of building AI systems capable of robust, generalizable reasoning across languages, domains, and modalities.
