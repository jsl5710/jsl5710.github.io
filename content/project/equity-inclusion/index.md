The benefits and harms of generative AI are not distributed equally. This project examines how AI systems disproportionately impact long-tail users—speakers of underserved languages and members of marginalized communities who are often excluded from model training and evaluation. By quantifying these disparities and analyzing how generative AI amplifies existing inequities in the information ecosystem, this work makes the case that equitable AI is not optional but essential. It bridges AI for Social Good with Safe and Ethical AI, centering the voices and needs of communities that current technologies routinely overlook.
