Language technologies often fail beyond a handful of well-resourced languages, leaving billions of speakers vulnerable to disinformation and harmful content. This project develops multilingual approaches for detecting fake news, false claims, and machine-generated text across diverse linguistic landscapes—spanning 70+ languages. By building large-scale benchmarks and leveraging transfer learning techniques, this work directly addresses the Digital Language Divide, ensuring that information integrity tools are not limited to English or other high-resource languages but extend protection to the communities most susceptible to unchecked disinformation.
